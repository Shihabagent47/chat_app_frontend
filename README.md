## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart
- Android Studio or Xcode (for mobile development)
- A backend server (not included in this repo)

### Backend Server

This project requires a backend server to function. You can find the official backend implementation here:

ðŸ‘‰ [chat-app-server (GitHub)](https://github.com/Shihabagent47/chat-app-server)

Follow the instructions in the backend repository to set up and run the server locally or deploy it to your preferred environment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat_app_frontend.git
   cd chat_app_frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

### Running with Flavors (Environments)

This project supports multiple environments (flavors): **development**, **staging**, and **production**. Each environment has its own main entrypoint.

To run the app in a specific environment, use the `--target` option with `flutter run`:

- **Development**
  ```sh
  flutter run --flavor development -t lib/main_development.dart
  ```
- **Staging**
  ```sh
  flutter run --flavor staging -t lib/main_staging.dart
  ```
- **Production**
  ```sh
  flutter run --flavor production -t lib/main_production.dart
  ```

You can use these commands for all supported platforms (Android, iOS, web, desktop). For example, to run the production flavor on web:

```sh
flutter run -d chrome --target=lib/main_production.dart
```

> **Note:** Make sure to use the correct device flag (`-d`) for your target platform.
